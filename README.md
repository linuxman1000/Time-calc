# time_calculate.py

Written By: Mike Hauss (mikehauss at gmail dot com)

This is a Python script that accepts a number of seconds and converts it to bigger units (years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes and the remaining seconds, if any.)
-s or --seconds is not currently available and will be written in when I get a bite of time.

## How can this be useful?
This is useful anytime you have an amount of seconds and want to know how long ago x seconds was.  Many applications express time in seconds.  For example, DNS TTLs are expressed in seconds and many Linux utilities express an amount of time in seconds, even if it's been years.

## Requirements:
Python 3

_Notes:_ 

_1. This program is designed to be used on a CLI._

## Usage:
```
time_calculate.py

arguments: None
The script will prompt with how many seconds

There is still much to be done on this, so it is a work in progress.  However, feel free to use this.
