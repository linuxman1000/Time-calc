# time_calculate.py

Written By: Mike Hauss (mikehauss at gmail dot com)

Converts seconds to bigger units (years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes)
-s or --seconds is converted to years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes and remaining seconds.
Everything else is converted to the equivalent seconds

## How can this be useful?
This is useful anytime you have an amount of seconds and want to know how long ago x seconds was.  Many applications express time in seconds.  For example, DNS TTLs are expressed in seconds and many Linux utilities express an amount of time in seconds, even if it's been years.

## Requirements:
Python 3

_Notes:_ 

_1. This program is designed to be used on a CLI._

## Usage:
```
time_calculate.py

arguments: None
The script will prompt with how many seconds

There is still much to be done on this, so it is a work in progress.  However, feel free to use this.
